# Large Scale Classification of Astronomical Objects

This project involves developing an open-world multi-class classification
tool for the [SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey](http://rsaa.anu.edu.au/research/projects/skymapper-southern-sky-survey).

Links to IPython notebooks:

1. [Sloan Digital Sky Survey Classification](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/alasdairtran/mclass-sky/blob/master/1.%20Sloan%20Digital%20Sky%20Suvey.ipynb): We apply some of the popular
classifiers to the SDSS data.

The datasets are too big for GitHub. They can be downloaded from
[my Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yrhifi5s1qikfh8/AAAZg6BouEalG1yjbUJK4gvea?dl=0).
