#README

The mkdocs folder contains the files required to generate the documentation for mclearn
using mkdocs.

##Notes:
1. For equations which use the `align` environment, it has to be explicitly
   included:

   ```
   $$\begin{align}...\end{align}$$
   ```
##Todo:
1. Autogenerate API documentation from docstrings, like Sphinx does.
