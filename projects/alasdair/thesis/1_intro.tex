\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}
The night sky has always been a source of wonder throughout history. Even before the Age of
Science, we used our built-in pattern recognition and tried to assign a purpose to
the cosmos with stories of gods and the supernatural. Then came the Ancient Greeks who brought
mathematics to astronomy and sought a more rational explanation of celestial bodies.
But we could only discover so much with our naked eyes. It was not until the invention
of new technology during the Scientific Revolution like the telescope that we began to
make significantly more progress. And yet, 400 years after Galileo made the first working
telescope, most of the sky still remains unknown to us.

This, however, is starting to change. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) began
in 2000 and has since obtained 800 million sets of photometric measurements
and 3 million spectra of the northern sky. Similar projects are going on
to map the southern sky including the VST ATLAS. We now face another challenge of how
to analyse this huge amount of data. Fortunately, we can bring machine learning
to astronomy and let the computer to do the pattern recognition task.
This thesis is an attempt to study a small part of the interaction between these
two disciplines.

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
The main contribution of the thesis is an investigation of Thompson sampling to automatically
select the optimal active learning heuristic. Along the way, we compare three competing sets
of reddening corrections and see which one is best at estimating dust extinction.
We also present an extension of the
posterior balanced accuracy rate to the multi-class setting, which will be used to evaluate
the performance of our algorithms.

An important part of this project involves creating an
open-source, extendable, and well-documented Python package that allows astronomers to perform active learning
routines and make quick visualisations of photometric data. The package and
reproducible code of all experiments are available on the project's GitHub repository\footnote{
	\url{https://github.com/alasdairtran/mclearn}}.

\section{Thesis Outline}
\label{sec:orgnisation}
The thesis consists of four main chapters, two of which are dedicated to a discussion of ideas and
the other two focus on the experiments:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Chapter \ref{cha:astro} introduces the reader to the tools that astronomers use
		to map the sky. This includes important concepts like photometry, magnitudes, dust
		extinction, and the celestial coordinate system. We also give a brief overview of
		two datasets, SDSS and VST ATLAS, that are used in our experiments.
		
		\item Chapter \ref{cha:ml} surveys the relevant literature in active learning. This leads
		to  a discussion of the multi-arm bandit problem and the use of Thompson sampling to a
		setting where each bandit arm is an active learning heuristic. We end the chapter with a 
		derivation of various performance measures.
		
		\item Chapter \ref{cha:expt1} and \ref{cha:expt2} test the ideas discussed so far in a
		series of experiments on the SDSS and the VST-ATLAS datasets. A detailed protocol and a
		thorough discussion of the results are given for each experiment. In particular, we offer
		insights into the areas where Thompson sampling outperforms random sampling and where it
		underperforms. 
	\end{itemize}
For those interested in reproducing the experiments and applying the ideas in this thesis
to their own datasets, the Appendix includes a guide on how to install and use the accompanying
Python package \texttt{mclearn}. We also provide information on how to obtain the SDSS dataset
with SQL queries.
