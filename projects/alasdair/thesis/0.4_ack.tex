I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr Cheng Soon Ong and Dr Christian Wolf, for their support
and encouragement throughout the year. Thank you for providing me with such an interesting project
to work on, for spending countless hours giving me valuable advice, and for always checking up on
me to make sure that I am still on track. I would also like to thank Chris Blake, Dominik Klaes,
Thomas Erben, Hendrik Hildebrandt, Catherine Heymans, Christian Wolf, and the whole VST ATLAS team
for allowing me to use data from their Southern Sky survey in my experiments. Finally I would
like to say a special thank you to my friend Lee Wei Yen and my family who have kept me sane
throughout my honours year.
