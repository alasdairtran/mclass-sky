I would like to thank Dr Cheng Soon Ong and Dr Christian Wolf for their support and encouragement
throughout the year, for spending countless hours giving me valuable advice,
and for always checking up on me to make sure that I am still on track.
I would also like to thank researchers from the VST ATLAS project for providing me with
data of the Southern Sky survey.
