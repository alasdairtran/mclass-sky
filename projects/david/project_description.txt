This project will involve understanding the analytic center cutting plane method (ACCPM) and applying it to active learning on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. The project will then aim to extend a paper in the machine learning literature using the ACCPM and then applying this extension to the SDSS data. The project will involve and develop skills and knowledge from machine learning, mathematics, statistics, and computing. The project will involve and develop understanding of research processes and tools in discplines with a significant computing aspect, particularly machine learning.
